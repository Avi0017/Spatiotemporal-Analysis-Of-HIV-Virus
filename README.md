## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes life expectancy and the spatial spread of the HIV virus using machine learning and geospatial visualization techniques. By integrating multiple data sources—including healthcare access, socio-economic factors, and HIV prevalence—we aim to understand disparities in global health outcomes and offer predictive tools for policymakers.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict life expectancy using machine learning models.
- Visualize geographical disparities in HIV prevalence.
- Correlate HIV distribution with reduced life expectancy.
- Develop interactive tools for decision-makers and researchers.
